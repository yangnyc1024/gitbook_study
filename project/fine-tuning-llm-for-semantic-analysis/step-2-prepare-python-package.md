# Step 2: Prepare python package



`requirements.txt` file should look something like this:

```
torch==2.0.0
accelerate==0.23.0
peft==0.5.0
bitsandbytes==0.41.1
transformers==4.31
trl==0.7.2
```

When someone wants to install these packages, they would use the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs the packages listed in it. The `-q` option for quiet mode and `-U` option for upgrading packages are not specified in the file but can be added to this command if desired. However, they are not typically used when installing from a `requirements.txt` because you're aiming for a specific, reproducible environment.
