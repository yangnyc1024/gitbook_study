# Series V & VI

## Summary

* Series V: Find One Shortest Path from branch of nodes to all the goal nodes in uniformly weighted graph (any one from the branch to one) 【任意源点对所有终点】
* Series VI: Fine One Shortest Path from all the starting nodes to any of the goal nodes in uniformly weighted graph(any one from the branch to one)【所有源点对任意终点】

这个就是\[any to all and all to any] problem

## Solution

* 永远把问题通过任意(any)这一侧出发：
  * all to any <=> any to all 从所有的start
