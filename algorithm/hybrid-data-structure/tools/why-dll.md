# Why DLL?

What benefits can we get from double linkedlist (DLL)?

* If we know the position of the node in DLL, the remove operation is $$O(1)$$
* maintain the order of access sequence - DLL
  * tail - sort property(most recently visited, etc)
  * head - sort property(lease recently visited, etc)
