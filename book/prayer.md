## A story about a dog and an elephant

* An elephant and a dog became pregnant at the same time
* Three months down the line, the dog gave birth to six puppies.
* Six months later, the dog was pregnant again. And nine months on, it gave birth to another dozen puppies.
* The pattern continued...On the eighteenth month, the dog approached the elephant, questioning, "Are you sure that you are pregnant? We became pregnant on the same date, I have given birth three times to a dozen puppies, and they are now grown to become big dogs, yet you are still pregnant. What is going on?"
* The elephant replied, "There is something I want you to understand. What I am carrying is not a puppy but an elephant. I only give birth to one in two years. When my baby hits the ground, the earth feels it. When my baby crosses the road, human beings stop and watch in admiration. What I carry draws attention. So what I am carrying is mighty and great."
* Don't lose faith when you see others receive answers to their prayers. If you have not received your own blessings. dont despair. Say to yourself, "My time is coming. When it hits the surface of the earth, people shall yield in admiration."
